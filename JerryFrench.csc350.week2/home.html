                    SANDSHREW's body is configured to absorb water without waste, 
                    enabling it to survive in an arid desert. 
                    
                    SANDSHREW has a very dry hide that is extremely tough. 
                    The POKéMON can roll into a ball that repels any attack.
                    
                     At night, it burrows into the desert sand to sleep. </h3>
